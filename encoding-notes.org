* Encoding Guidelines
** Alphabet Groups
   When the book is divided into sections devoted to one or more
   letters of the alphabet, enclose each of these sections in a
   structural <div type="alpha-group">.  Each of these <div> elements
   should have an xml:id attribute (conventionally given the value
   ag.N) and an ana attribute associating it with the appropriate
   letter group.
** Subject-Letters
   Often, the letter being described is the subject of the line or
   sentence (as in, "C is a Captain, who led on his men"). Tag these
   as <c type="subject-letter">.
