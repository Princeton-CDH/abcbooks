    <l>Our only chance is when we camp.</l>

    <l>A-swimming, you can see his nose,</l>
    <l>And nothing more except his track.</l>
    <l>If he ’s alarmed, a mighty smack</l>

    <l>They first looked on a white man’s</l>

    <l>That one day he would take their place.</l>

    <l>They still are here, but their fierce pride</l>

    <l>At the water’s rush and thunder !</l>

    <l>Father Hennepin saw that show</l>

   <lg>
    <l>IT's not the kind you put in tea,</l>

    <l>When men go out in Spring and tap</l>
    <l>The trunks and catch the fresh sweet sap,</l>

    <l>Which, after proper boiling, makes</l>
    <l>Brown maple sugar in hard cakes;</l>
    <l>And all one maple tree can do</l>
    <l>Is to make just a pound or two.</l>

    <l>Comes on your face sudden a freshening breeze,</l>
    <l>You see the trail's end and a ripple of blue,</l>

    <l>You felt you could Fill them up any way you would—</l>
    <l>With herds of charging buffalo,</l>
    <l>With Indian and Eskimo,</l>
    <l>With teepee, dogsled and igloo,</l>

    <l>And New France fell, and Montcalm died,</l>
