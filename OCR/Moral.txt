Having observed what utter nonsense is put into the mouths of children, and € the firm hold which it takes on their memories, (I refer to “A was an Archer that shot at a frog, &c.,) I have ventured to compose, in simple rhyme, what I will call “The Children’s Moral Alphabet," with the hope that it may as easily, and as permanently, lodge in the mind a few grains of truth which shall germinate, and even bear some fruit, in the future.
With this view, I submit it to the juvenile public, with my best wishes for their progress in all that is good and true. At the same time apologising for here and there giving a hint to the elder folk.
OCTOGENARIAN
Kettering, July, 1879.





<head>A</head>
Stands for the Ass: this burden he bore,—
A hag of good meal from the water-mill store;
Then should he be beaten ’cause slowly he trod ?
No! Neddy and meal are both creatures of God.


<head>B</head>
Stands for Bible, the book of all truth,
Which guides to the Saviour both old age and youth;
Dear England, old England, thy children are blest,
Not one need there he of this Book unpossessed.



<head>C</head>
Stands for Coat, that keeps me so warm,
When foot-deep in snow I am plodding the farm;
I shepherd the sheep, and think it’s their wool
That makes all the coats of the boys in our school.



<head>D</head>
Stands for Drunkard—oh, shocking the sight!
Let me ne'er be found in such wretched plight:
A grief to my parents, offensive to God-
Save me, 0 save me, from that downward road!

<head>E</head>
Stands for Eagle, who soars as he flies,
Upwards, still upwards, he mounts to the skies;
While he who hates learning, an Idler lies down,
Content to he always an ignorant clown,


<head>F</head>
Stands for a Fool, an Atheist he;
At the great judgment-day, oh, where will he be?
Speechless, confounded, with agonized heart,
Awaiting his sentence—Depart ye, depart!


<head>G</head>
G Stands for Goliath, six cubits in height,
In armour complete equipped for the light;
I While cursing young David, with boastful disdain,
Forth flew the missile: the Giant was slain.

<head>H</head>
Stands for Home, so sweet and so comely,
For love makes it sweet, be it ever so I homely;
Then brothers and sisters pray love one another,
Joy will it bring to both Father and Mother.


<head>I</head>
Stands for Ink, let all try to use it,
But never take pen whereby to abuse it;
For it, like the tongue, true friendships may sever,
To unite again—when? the time may come never.


<head>J</head>
Stands for the Judge, who solemnly sits
To lay down the law that condemns or acquits;
While twelve honest men take oath on the spot,
To give a true verdict, of guilty or not.

<head>K</head>
Stands for the King, who sits on the Throne;
He speaks of “ mj people," but we're not his own:
Our grand Constitution, I’m proud to relate,
Is King, Lords, and Commons,—we call it the State,


<head>L</head>
Stands for lamb, what a time honoured name!
Since Jesus, the Lord, is well known by the same;
For lo! on the Cross He gave up His breath,
To save a lost world from sin and from death.

<head>M</head>
Stands for Mother, fair emblem of love,
Who nursed me, and fed me, and called me her dove:
)h what can I render such love and affection
n weakness and age? ij kindest protection.

<head>N</head>
Stands for Neighbour, oh, what says the lord ?
“Love him as yourself," it stands on record ;
And should he offend you, to seven times even,
Your love must forgive to seventy times seven.

<head>O</head>
Stands for Oyster, with rough-coated shell;
When the morsel you've tasted, examine it well;
Judge no man in haste, it will not be kind,
The outside is nothing: the pearl is the mind.


<head>P</head>
Stands for Peter, sad storj to tell,—
He trusted in self: you know how he fell; 
But was kindly restored by a glance of the eye
From Jesus, his Saviour, lest Peter should die.

<head>Q</head>
Stands for Quick: it’s no nse delaying;
Time flies apace, and never means staying;
So ponder the thought, that man, like a flower,
Though blooming with health, is cut down in an hour,

<head>R</head>
Stands for a Rose, the garden’s fair queen;
How lovely the pink, how charming the green!
Not less the fair maiden adds grace to her beauty,
When love and affection give impulse to duty.

<head>S</head>
Stands for the Sun, he sends out his rays,
He lights np the earth, her grandeur displays;
The air fills with music from coppice and wood,
Proclaiming in chorus the goodness of God.

<head>T</head>
Stands for Tiger, whose nature is cruel,
And men are no better who fight in a duel:
Nor should Christian nations partake the disgrace
Of sanctioning war, to destroy their own race.

<head>U</head>
Stands for "Ursus," in English, the Bear;
An ugly old fellow, so pray you beware!
A brute may be bearish, but men should know better;
Youth should be kind, and polite to the letter.

<head>V</head>
H, Holy Father, no culture but Thine,
Can make me a branch of Christ, the true Vine;
Thy pruning alone, by faith and by prayer,
Can make the good fruit in rich clusters appear.


<head>W</head>
WEATHERCOCK, Weathercock, turned by the wind,
Type of the man who knows not his own mind;
While valiant for truth, he stands like a tower,
His girdle is strength, his armour is power.

<head>X</head>
NOT a word in our language begins with an X,
But there he sits striding, poor Rhymer to vex;
Be patient, poor Rhymer, don’t trouble your head,
But close your long ditty with— X, Y and Z

<head>XYZ</head>
BUT oh, Mr. Rhymer, you spoke of politeness:
We ask, Is it right, by dint of adroitness,
That we should he left as though we were dead ?
We rank with our fellows as X, Y, and Z.
So pray, aged Sir, our minds to compose,
dive us a last word, in rhyme or in prose.

Rhymer :
My farewell advice in prose I will give,
Which please to remember as long as you live.

"Fear- God."
"Honour the King."
"Love and obey your Parents."
"As much as lieth in you, live in peace with all men."
