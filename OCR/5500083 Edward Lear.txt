Who never stood still,
But they made a nice house
On the side of the a hill
A!
Nice little ants!

B was a Bat,
Who flew out at night
When the stars are seen,
And the moon gioves a light.
b!
Brown little bat!

C
C was a Cat
Who ran after a rat
Whose courage did fail
When Puss seized on his tail
C!
Clever old Cat!
