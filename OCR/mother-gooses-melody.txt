Mother Goose’s Melody,
A DIRGE.
Little Betty Winckle she had a pig,
It was a little pig, not very big;
When he was alive he liv’d on clover,
But now he’s dead, and that’s all
over.
Johnny Winckle he
Sat down and cried,
Betty W inckle she
Laid down and died :
So there was an end of one, two,
and three,
Johnny Winckle he,
Betty Winckle she,
And Piggy Wiggy.

A dirge is a song made for the dead: but whether this was made for Betty Winckle or her Pig, is uncertain ; no notice being taken of it by Camden, or anv of the famous antiquaries.


The sow came in with a saddle.
The little pig rock’d the cradle,
The dish jump’d a-top of the table,
To see the pot wash the ladle;
The spit that stood behind the door
Call’d dishclout dirty o’er and o’er.
Odds-plut, says the gridiron,
Can’t you agree?
I’m the head constable.
Bring ’em to me.
If he acts as constable in this case, the cook must surely be the justice of peace.


Cock a doodle doo,
My dame has lost her shoe,
My master has lost his fiddle-stick,
And knows not what to do.


One, two, three, four, five,
I caught a hare alive;
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
I let him go again.

O my kitten, a kitten,
And oh ! my kitten a deary,
Such a sweet pap as this
There is not far nor neary:
Here we go up, up, up.
Here we go down, down, down,
Here we go backwards and forwards,
And here we go round, round, round.



There was a man of Thessaly,
And he was wond’rous wise,
He jump’d into a quickset hedge,
And scratch’d out both his eyes;
And when he saw his eyes were out,
With all his might and main.
He j ump’d into another hedge,
And scratch’d them in again.

How happy it was for the man to scratch his eyes in again, when they were scratched out! But he was a blockhead, or lie would have kept himself out of the hedge, and not been scratched at all.

Great A, little a,
Bouncing B;
The cat’s in the cupboard,
And she can’t see.


Patty cake, patty cake, baker’s man;
That I will, master, as fast as I can;
Prick it, and prick it, and mark it with a T,
And there will be enough for Jackey and me,
There was an old woman,
And she sold puddings and pies;
She went to the mill,
And the dust flew into her eyes.
Hot pies and cold pies to sell!
Wherever she goes, 
You may follow her by the smell.



See saw, Margery Daw,
Jackey shall have a new master:
Jackey must have but a penny a day.
Because he can work no faster.

Bow, wow, wow,
Whose dog art thou?
Little Tom Tinker’s dog,
Bow, wow, wow.

Tom Tinker’s dog is a very great dog, and an honester dog than his master.



Robin and Richard
Were two pretty men,
They lay in bed
Till the clock struck ten ;
Then up starts Robin,
And looks at the sky,
Oh ! brother Richard,
The sun's very high ;
You go before
With the bottle and bag,
And I will come after
On little Jack nag.

When I was a little boy,
1 liv'd by myself,
And all the bread
And cheese I got
I laid upon the shelf;
The rats and the mice,
They made such a strife,
That I was forc'd to go to town
And buy me a wife:
The streets were so broad,
The lanes were so narrow,
1 was forc’d to bring my wife home
In a wheelbarrow :
The wheelbarrow broke.
And my wife had a fall,
Farewell, wheelbarrow,
Wife, and all.


Boys and girls, come out to play.
The moon doth shine as bright as
day;	[a call,
Come with a hoop, and come with
Come with a good will, or not at all.
Lose your supper, and lose your
sleep,	[street.
Come to your playfellows in the
Up the ladder and down the wall,
A halfpenny loaf will serve us all.

Piping hot, smoking hot, what I've
You have not,	[got
Hot grey pease, hot, hot, hot,
Hot grey pease, hot.


There were two blackbirds
Sat upon a hill,
The one nam’d Jack,
The other nam’d Gill;
Fly away Jack,
Fly away Gill,
Come again Jack,
Come again Gill.

See, saw, sacradown,
Wh ich is the way to London town
One foot up, the other foot down,
That is the way to London town.

Or to any other town upon the face of the earth.



A DOLEFUL DITTY.
Three children sliding on the ice
Upon a summer’s day,
As it fell out, they all fell in,
The rest they run away.

O! had these children beenatschool
Or sliding on dry ground,
Ten thousand pounds to one penny,
They had not then been drown’d.

Ye parents who have children dear,
And eke ye who have none,
If you would keep them safe abroad,
Pray keep them safe at home.


Hush-a-by baby,
On the tree top,
When the wind blows
The cradle will rock ;
When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall,
Down tumbles baby,
Cradle and all.

Cross patch, draw the latch,
Sit by the fire and spin ;
Take a cup, and drink it up,
Then call your neighbours in.


Tell-tale tit,
Your tongue shall be slit,
And all the dogs in our town
Shall have a bit.

Little Tom Tucker
Sings for his supper;
What shall he eat?
White bread and butter:
How will he cut it.
Without e’er a knife?
How will he be married,
Without e’er a wife!

I won't be my father's Jack,
I won't be my father’s Gill,
I will be the fiddler s wife,
And have music when I will.
T'other little tune.
T’other little tune.
Prithee, love, play me
T’other little tune.

What care I how black I be,
Twenty pounds will marry me;
If twenty won’t, forty shall :
I am my mother’s bouncing girl.


Ding clong bell,
The cat is in the well.
Who put her in ?
Little Johnny Green.
What a naughty boy was that
To drown poor Pussy Cat,
Who never did any harm, [barn.
And killed the mice in his father’s

There was an old woman lived under a hill;
And if she’s not gone, she lives there still.

This is a self-evident proposition, which is the very essence of truth. " She liv’d under the hill; and if she’s not gone, she
lives there still.” Nobody will presume to contradict this.


There was an old woman
Liv'd under a hill;
She put a mouse in a bag,
And sent it to the mill :
The miller did swear
By the point of his knife,
He never took toll
Of a mouse in his life.

The only instance of a miller refusing toll, and for which the cat has just cause of complaint against him.


A LEARNED SONG.
Here’s A, B, and C, D, E, F, and G,
H, 1, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q,
R, S, T, and U,
W, X, Y, and Z.
And here’s the child’s dad,
Who is sagacious and discerning,
And knows this is the fount of learning.

This is the most learned ditty in the world; for, indeed, there is nothing can be made without the aid of this, it being the gamut and ground-work of them all.



There were two birds sat on a stone,
Fa la la, la lal de;
o ne flew away, and then there was one,
Fa la la, la lal de;
The other flew after,
And then there was none,
Fa la la, la lal de;
And then the poor stone
Was left alone,
Fa la la, la lal de.

This may serve as a chapter of consequence in the next new book of logic.


Bah ! bah ! black sheep,
Have you any wool?
Yes, marry, have I; 
Three bags full.
One for my master,
One for my dame.
But none for the little boy
Who cries in the lane.

Dickery, dickery, dock,
The mouse ran up the clock;
The clock struck one,
The mouse ran down.
Dickery, dickery, dock.


Who comes here?
A grenadier.
What do you want?
A pot of beer.
Where is your money?
I’ve forgot.
Get you gone,
You drunken sot.


Three wise men of Gotham,
They went to sea in a bowl;
And if the bowl had been stronger,
My song had been longer.

It is long enough. Never lament the loss of what is not worth having.


High diddle diddle.
The cat and the fiddle!
The cow jump’d over the moon ;
The little dog laugh’d,
To see such craft,
And the dish ran away with the spoon.
It must be a little dog that laughed, for a great dog would be ashamed to laugh at such nonsense.



Is John Smith within?
Yes, that he is.
Can he set a shoe ?
Aye, marry, two.
H ere a nail, and there a nail,
Tick, tack, too.

Pease-porridge hot,
Pease-porridge cold,
Pease-porridge in the pot
Nine days old.
Spell me that in four letters.
I will, T, H, A, T.



Ride a cock horse
To Banbury Cross,
To see what Tommy can buy;
A penny white loaf,
A penny white cake,
And a two-penny apple-pie.

Jack and Gill
Went up the hill,
To fetch a pail of water ;
Jack fell down,
And broke his crown,
And Gill came tumbling after.


Shoe the colt,
Shoe the colt,
Shoe the wild mare;
H ere a nail,
Th ere a nail,
Yet she goes bare.

There was an old man,
And he had a calf;
And that’s half.
He took him out of the stall,
And put him on the wall;
And that's all.

Those who are given to tell all they know, generally tell more than they know.


This pig went to market,
That pig staid at home.
This pig had roast meat,
That pig had none ;
This pig went to the barn-door,
And cried Week, week, for more.

Little Jack Horner
Sat in the corner,
Eating of Christmas pie;
He put in his thumb,
And pull’d out a plum,
And said, What a good boy am I !


1 would if I could,
If I cou’dn’t, how could I?
1 cou’dn’t, without 1 could, could 11
Could vou, without you could,
could ye?
Could ye, could ye?
Could you, without you could,
could ye ?

This is a new way of handling an old argument, said to be invented by a famous senator; but it has something in it of gothic construction.



A long-tail’d pig, or a short-tail'd
Ora pig without a tail;
* A sow pig, or a boar pig.
Or a pig with a curling tail.
Take hold of his tail, and eat off
his head,
And then you'll be sure the pig is
dead.


1.
There was a little man.
And he woo’d a little maid ;
And he said, Little maid, will you
wed, wed, wed?
I have little more to say;
So will you ? aye or nay ;
For the least said is soonest mended,
ded, ded.

2.
Then replied the little maid,
Little Sir, you’ve little said,
To induce a little maid for to wed,
wed, wed.
You must say a little more,
And produce a little ore,
Ere I make a little print in ycui
bed, bed, bed.

3.
Then the little man replied,
If you will be my bride,
I’ll raise my love-notes a little
higher, higher, higher;
Though my offers are not meet.
Yet my little heart is great,
With the little god of love all on
fire, fire, fire.

4.
Then the little maid replied.
Should I be your little bride,
Pray, what shall we have for to eat,
eat, eat?	[in
Will the flame that you’re so rich
Light a fire in the kitchen ?
Or the little god of love turn the
spit, spit, spit?

5.
Then the little man he sigh'd.
And, some say, a little cried.
For his heart was big with sorrow,
sorrow, sorrow;
