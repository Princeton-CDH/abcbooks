All you Book-loving Chubbies,
Come - gather round me:
You shall have such a treat - 
(Mind - there'snothing to eat!)
But all my fine Pictures you'll certainly see,
Andwe'll play such a jolly Game
call'd
ABC

a Was an Archer
who shot at a Frog.

b Was a Butcher who
had a big Dog.

Tuts! these are the Rhymes
That our Grandmothers knew;
They’re far too old-fashioned:
Let’s have something new.


SURELY that Archer who's been shooting at that
Frog for so many Generations must be a bad
shot, or he'd have killed him long ago.

We all know that the Sparrow killed Cock Robin,
because the Fly saw him die, and think, as Froggy's
gone a wooin', he's much better employed than being
shot at, so pack him off with his Opera hat to make
room for new matter for our present generation of
little learners.
