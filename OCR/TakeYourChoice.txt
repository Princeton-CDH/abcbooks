      <l>A, ARTHUR AIMWELL, of right takes the rule,</l>
      <l>By letter as Chief of the Boys of our School ;—</l>
      <l>In duty submissive we yield to his sway,</l>
      <l>As first of the Alphabet family,—A ;</l>
      <l>And still that his name may with honour be crown'd.</l>
      <l>No primer without his initial is found.</l>
    </lg>

<div>
    <head>B b</head>
    <lg>
      <l>B is BOB BOOBY,—how sulky his look!</l>
      <l>Whom nobody loves, for he loves not his book;</l>
      <l>When call'd, by the Usher, to spell or to read,</l>
      <l>He whimpering cries, " I don't know it indeed!"</l>
      <l>The rod and fool's cap he has had in their turn,</l>
      <l>But Bob seems resolved that he never will learn.</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
      <l>C is CHARLES CAREFUL, whom none can surpass.</l>
      <l>So clever, he's now at the head of our class ;</l>
      <l>So dutiful, kind, and obliging beside,</l>
      <l>The joy of his friends, of his parents the pride ;</l>
      <l>His worth to proclaim, and his person to deck,</l>
      <l>A Medal of Merit he wears at his neck.</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
      <l>D is DO-LITTLE, who scarce knows a letter,</l>
      <l>Yet willing to learn, he soon hopes to Do better ;</l>
      <l>Intent on his lesson he sits by himself,</l>
      <l>And heeds no impertinent mischievous elf;</l>
      <l>We love the fine fellow, and, eager to tell</l>
      <l>Our friendly affection, we call him Do-well.</l>
    </lg>

    <head>E e</head>
    <lg>
      <l>E is TOM EASY, whom nothing annoys,</l>
      <l>But who with mere trifles his time oft employs.</l>
      <l>One day in our school, as he play'd with the Cat,</l>
      <l>The Usher demanded,—"Tom, what are you at?"</l>
      <l>In lack then of speech, poor Tom Pussey cried Mew,"</l>
      <l>Tom Easy I mean," said the Usher, " not You J"</l>
    </lg>
</div>

<div>
    <head>F f</head>
    <lg>
      <l>F is FRANK FRETFUL,—the boys love to tease him,</l>
      <l>So peevish and cross, there is nothing can please him;</l>
      <l>When told of his faults, he says, " What's that to you?"</l>
      <l>And point but your finger, he cries "Have done, do!"</l>
      <l>While around him we caper and cheerfully sing,</l>
      <l>He blares like a Calf in the midst of the ring!</l>
    </lg>

    <lg>
      <l>G is GEORGE GOSSIP, a tale-bearing youth.</l>
      <l>Delighting in fibs, and regardless of truth ;</l>
      <l>His schoolfellows dread him, and, seeing him come.</l>
      <l>Each lifts up a finger, and all exclaim "Mum !"</l>
      <l>For when with his tales he thinks fit to begin,</l>
      <l>He dashes away, through thick and through thin.</l>
    </lg>
</div>

      <l>H is HAL HARDY, all danger he scorns:</l>
      <l>He seized a fierce Billy-Goat once by the horns,</l>
      <l>Which, rearing, had threaten'd to give Hal a fall,</l>
      <l>And seem'd much inclined to wage war on us all:—</l>
      <l>"Cry Quarter" said Hal:—the goat could not obey,</l>
      <l>But he sprang from his victor, and scamper'd away.</l>
    </lg>

      <l>I is young IDLER, whom here you may see,</l>
      <l>And his name and his character strictly agree;</l>
      <l>At school he's the last, coming in,—going out,</l>
      <l>The last in whatever the boys are about:</l>
      <l>If so he continue, 'tis easy to tell</l>
      <l>The last he will be in the world to do well.</l>
    </lg>

      <l>J is JEM JOLLY, the JESTER, no fool, Alert when at play and attentive at school;</l>
      <l>The life of our sports, and whose juvenile wit To each in his turn gives a palpable hit;</l>
      <l>But as none of his jokes are design'd to give pain. So none of his playmates are heard to complain.</l>

      <l>Whose kind disposition is seen in each feature.:</l>
      <l>His fruit or his cakes after school he'll divide,</l>
      <l>And lay for himself the least portion aside.</l>
      <l>To all in distress his benevolence flows,</l>
      <l>And all bid " Heaven bless him 1" wherever he goes.</l>

      <l>Can well of dull care all his comrades beguile;</l>
      <l>At home or abroad, in our school, or at play,</l>
      <l>He's affable, friendly, good-humour'd and gay ;</l>
      <l>Yet sometimes most gravely this lad takes the chair,</l>
      <l>And settles disputes like a Judge or Lord Mayor !</l>
    </lg>

      <l>M is MARK MEANWELL, severe in reproof,</l>
      <l>From whom Master Gossip had long kept aloof;</l>
      <l>George wore a black clolce that was losing its dye,</l>
      <l>Mark offer'd a substitute then to supply,</l>
      <l>A black of firm jet, that would strike all beholders,</l>
      <l>'What'sthat?' Throw your character over your shoulders!M</l>
     </lg>

    <lg>
      <l>N is NED NOVICE, who seems to take pains</l>
      <l>In aiming at wit, yet a Novice remains;</l>
      <l>Do-little in silence long bore his abuse,</l>
      <l>"You dare not," said Novice, "cry Boh ! to a goose.'</l>
      <l>"I dare though," Do-little replied, and to show</l>
      <l>His courage, he look'd in Ned's face and cried, Boh !</l>
     </lg>
</div>

<div>
    <head>O o</head>

      <l>O is young OLIVER ODD-ONE, when foil'd</l>
      <l>Ned Novice at wit, by Do-little the child,</l>
      <l>A donkey was browsing apart from two others,—</l>
      <l>" See," Ned said to Oliver, " one of your brothers.</l>
      <l>Or one of your family ranging the sod on !"</l>
      <l>'How so?' 'Why,' cried Ned, 'don't you see he's an odd-one.'</l>

    <head>P p</head>
    <lg>
      <l>P, PETER PEEVISH,—no patience has he,</l>
      <l>But scalds both his mouth and his throat with his tea,</l>
      <l>Then picks with his fingers the crumbs from the loaf,</l>
      <l>And cries, when reproved, like a great silly oaf:</l>
      <l>At home or at school, let him be where he will,</l>
      <l>Poor Peter is peevish and petulant still.</l>
    </lg>
</div>

<div>
    <head>Q q</head>
    <lg>
      <l>Q is the QUERIST, who runs from his task,</l>
      <l>Some foolish and frivolous question to ask:</l>
      <l>'What's your name? what's the hour? which way shall you go?</l>
      <l>What toys have you got ? what tales do you know ?'</l>
      <l>But ah! the enquirer, now jeer'd by each scorner,</l>
      <l>Is order'd to stand like poor Q, in a corner.</l>

      <l>Still heedless of what he may think, or may say.</l>
      <l>A Rhymist is Roger; " Observe now this rule,"</l>
      <l>Our Usher once said, " Every Poet's a fool."</l>
      <l>Indeed, sir ! said Bob, I dont happen to know it;</l>
      <l>But one thing I know, every fool's not a poet."</l>
     </lg>

      <l>S is SAM SOP,—see how hungry his look!</l>
      <l>From morning to dinner-time teazing the cook ;</l>
      <l>He fell in the dripping once. Oh ! how he squall'd !</l>
      <l>Now what is the matter?" his frighten'd Aunt bawl'd; </l>
      <l>"Why, nothing at all, Ma'am," the Cook thus began,</l>
      <l>"A Trifle,—'tis only a SOP in the pan!"</l>
    </lg>
</div>

    <head>T t</head>

      <l>Who tbok, to screen Do-little, panic-struck elf;</l>
      <l>And Trusty well flogg'd then was order'd to be,</l>
      <l>"Oh, don't, cried the culprit, 'twas me! it was me!"</l>
      <l>Tim Trusty the Master's high favour thus gain'd,</l>

      <l>Who two-pence to-day will permit you to borrow,</l>
      <l>Provided that four-pence you pay him to-morrow;— </l>
      <l>But to lend without int'rest he's never inclined,</l>
      <l>For no generous feeling exists in his mind,</l>
    </lg>
</div>

<div>
    <head>V v</head>
    <lg>
      <l>V, VICARY VAINLOVE, a genius who owes</l>
      <l>His self-estimation alone to his clothes;</l>
      <l>Urigifted by worth, against merit a railer,</l>
      <l>He trusts for regard to the skill of his Tailor.</l>
      <l>"Your pride let this bird," said our Usher," subdue,</l>
      <l>The peacock GOD made, but a Tailor made you!"</l>

      <l>W, WISEBOY with pleasure I greet,</l>
      <l>For with knowledge no doubt such a youth is replete.</l>
      <l>In reading, in spelling, in using the pen,</l>
      <l>And casting up figures, he'll equal some men ;</l>
      <l>Nay of grammar itself he knows every rule,—</l>
      <l>So you see he's an honour indeed to our school.</l>
    </lg>

      <l>X is our XERXES,—a Captain we boast,</l>
      <l>Who like his great namesake might head an armed host;</l>
      <l>This honour denied, we yet yield to his rule,</l>
      <l>Commander in Chief of the Boys of our School, ;</l>
      <l>He marshals our ranks, and he measures each pace,</l>
      <l>And puts us about to the right and left face.</l>
  </lg>

<div>
    <head>Y y</head>
    <lg>

      <l>"The rod," cried the Usher, " I'll thrust down your maw,</l>
      <l>Shut your mouth ! " ''Yes, I will, sir, yaw-a-a-yaw!"</l>
      <l>The Usher then y-a-w-n'd, and the Boys all y-a-w-n'd too,</l>
      <l>Gape, Reader, and try,—so perhaps then may you !</l>

      <l>"The last did you say I" cried the mirth-loving Zany, </l>
      <l>"I'll prove it thc./b'.rf and most honour'd of any."</l>

      <l>THE ZANY's TALE</l>
      <l>Pat Murphy, resolving a guinea to spare,</l>
      <l>Once ventur'd a bet on the plains of Kildare,</l>
      <l>That Zany my namesake, a favourite horse,</l>
      <l>Would gain all the honours, that day, of the course,</l>
      <l>But Zany was distanced and last in the race;</l>
      <l>"By the Powers! " cried Pat, still maintaining his case,</l>
      <l>"The honours are won, here he comes in terrorem— </l>
      <l>Young Zany,—and drives all the racers before him."</l>

      <l>So Z still aspires your favour to claim,</l>
      <l>For Zeal without him could not boast of a name.</l>
