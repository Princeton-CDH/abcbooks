§S|®|AVING observed what utter nonsense is
put into the mouths of children, and
€ the firm hold which it takes on their
memories, (I refer to “A was an Archer that
shot at a frog, &c.,) I have ventured to com-
pose, in simple rhyme, what I will call “The
Children’s Moral Alphabet,” with the
hope that it may as easily, and as perma-
nently, lodge in the mind a few grains of
truth which shall germinate, and even bear
some fruit, in the future.
With this view, I submit it to the juvenile
public, with my best wishes for their progress
in all that is good and true. At the same
time apologising for here and there giving a
hint to the elder folk.
Kettering, July, 1879.

ux A
Stands for the Ass: this burden he bore,—
A hag of good meal from the water-mill
store;
Then should he be beaten ’cause slowly
he trod ?
No! Neddy and meal are both creatures
of God.

if Stands for Goliath, six cubits in height,
y In armour complete equipped for the light;
I While cursing young David, with boastful
disdain,
Forth flew the missile: the Giant was slain.
Boast not of your stature, your valour, or skill,
Faith gains the victory, and not human will.

For love makes it sweet, be it ever so

Then brothers and sisters pray love one

Joy will it bring to both Father and
Mother.

To lay down the law that condemns or

To give a true verdict, of guilty or not.

Who nursed me, and fed me, and called

In weakness and age? my kindest pro-

Stands for Tiger, whose nature is cruel,
And men are no better who fight in a duel:
Nor should Christian nations partake the

Of sanctioning war, to destroy their own
race.

p We rank with our fellows as X, Y, and Z.
w So pray, aged Sir, our minds to compose,
