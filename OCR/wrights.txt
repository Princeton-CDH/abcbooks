A is the Artist,
Who drew in these pages-
He's not had his hair cut-
For ages and ages.

B is the baby
Who is crowing with joy,
But isn't that diggie
A bad, greedy boy?

C is for Cook
Bow how very absurd,
For such a large cook to cook
Such a small bird

D is for Doctor
Who comes when you're ill
He looks at your tongue,
Then gives you a pill.


E is for Errand Boy,
Who loves to watch dogs fight,
his master’s meat is eaten
by the bow-wows on the right.

F is for Fireman,
This one is very brave,
He's climbed up the ladder
Poor pussy to save.

G  is for Gardener,
His enemies are snails:
He catches them with salt you know,
Then drowns hem in pails.

H is for Horse,
No wonder Cabby smiles ;
It’s only taken three short hours
To travel three long miles.

I is for Italian,
Who is fond of Macaroni
We don't know what his name is
We rather think it's Tony.

J is for Judy
Her husband's name is Punch,
And  together with
dog Toby
They are a happy bunch.

K is for Kitchen Maid,
Who's dropped the buttered scones.
We hope she hasn't hurt herself
Or broken any bones.

L is for Laundress
Her washing's very fine
When Fido fell into the tub
She hung him on the line.

M is for Milkman,
Why is he smiling so?
He likes a rainy day, for then
The milk is sure to grow.

N is for Nurse
Who says (and she knows)
That Wright's Coal Tar Soap
is as pure as a rose.


O is for Office-Boy,
in blue serge suit so neat,
Who points to the point of this picture,
Do you see it on that seat ?

Q is for Quarrel—
To be friends is better far—
We don’t like naughty children,
So let’s turn the page to R.

R is for Ride,
Also for Rotten Row,
The doggie runs beside and barks
To make the gee-gee go

S is for Sweep,
Whose face is very dirty,
And when he smiled and showed his
It frightened little Bertie, [teeth.

U is for Uncle,
Who brings pockets full of Toys,
UAnd always loves to romp and play
With little girls and boys.


W is for Willie,
Who is writing on the wall,
To let you know he uses
Wright’s Coal Tar Soap—
that’s	all

XYZ
At last - so we've been told-
The artist's had his hair cut
And caught a fearful cold.
