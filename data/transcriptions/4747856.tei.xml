               <l>INTRODUCTION</l>
               <l>Children are human, I confess,</l>
               <l>Though interesting none the less;</l>
               <l>For often one redeeming fault</l>
               <l>Is like the necessary salt</l>
               <l>That brings a flavor rich and sweet</l>
               <l>Into the viands that you eat.</l>
               <l>But there are faults like pepper, too —</l>
               <l>And like Tabasco not a few.</l>
               <l>So, if you find you have a vice,</l>
               <l>Be sure it’s just the proper spice;</l>
               <l>Of over-seasoning have a fear,</l>
               <l>And use it only once a year!</l>
               <l>Three hundred virtues to one vice</l>
               <l>Will keep you reasonably nice, [teach,</l>
               <l>That’s what the Goops have come to</l>
               <l>For they have only one of each!</l>

               This is the way Abedbego acts when he is told to go to bed. He doubles up his fists, and says, "I won't!" Abednego and Haychu and Zeemsneaze were all out in the garden playing horse. Abednego's sister Ethel called to them to come into the house, for it was five o’clock. They all three ran in as fast as they could, for they thought that perhaps she had some candy for them. Zeemsneaze put his cap on the hall table, and his drum on the floor. They found that Mr. Jack, the young man who came so often to see Ethel, was in the drawing-room with her, and Henry, the butler, was just bringing in some tea and cakes for them. Abednego raised his hat very politely, and gave Ethel a pink he had picked in the garden. But when she told him it was time for him to go to bed, he threw his hat on the floor, and stamped his foot, and said, “I won’t!” But Haychu obeyed promptly, and you can see she is half-way upstairs already, calling to Zeemsneaze. Abednego would not stir, so Mr. Jack had to carry him upstairs, saying,
               “Some one told me that there were Goops in this house; 
               Are you a Goop?"</p>

            <p>This picture shows what a Goop Bawlfred could be, when he wanted to. He was out doors, playing with Whymusty and Nibolene. Whymusty had on his soldier cap, and Nibolene was eating a doughnut as usual. After a while they heard a noise down the street, and saw an automobile coming along. It was Bawlfred’s Uncle Harry, and on the back seats were Ethel and Miss Stilcum of Washington, who was visiting at the house. They had been riding in the Park. Whymusty said, “let’s race them!” and so the three children started running as fast as they could. Whymusty was ahead, and Nibolene’s hat had blown off, when Bawlfred stumbled and fell and hurt himself. But instead of getting up with a laugh, he began to cry! Just then his mother came along, and as she picked him up, she said, "Are you a Goop?"</p>

            <p>Cawlomar and Goblick and Carolesse were playing in the library when Mother came into the room. She said she wanted to write a letter to Father, and that the children must all go out into the stable to play, where they could make all the noise they wanted to. So Cawlomar put his toys carefully away on the top shelf. First, his box of building blocks, then his gas-ball and his funny wooden horse and the flannel elephant. Then all three went out quietly. When they got into the kitchen they found two loaves of chocolate cake Katy the cook had just baked. Goblick and Carolesse each picked a piece of frosting off and ate it, while Katy was not looking. Cawlomar went right back into the library and told his mother what they had done! She was very sorry about it, but sorrier that Cawlomar should tell tales. “You shall all three be punished for being so naughty,” she said. “Goblick and Carolesse must stand in the corner for ten minutes for being so greedy, and Cawlomar must do the same for running and telling on them! Are you a Goop?"</p>

            <p>It was a cloudy day when Mr. Jack called on Ethel, and, as they feared it might rain, they did not go out to walk, as they had intended, but stayed in the library. Mr. Jack is showing Ethel a card trick, and she is trying to find out how it is done. When it began to sprinkle, the Goops came into the house and began to watch Mr. Jack. Askalotte, with her bell, is sitting by Ethel, but to-day she is behaving very well, and is quite still. Inkfinga has his bottle, as usual, and you can see how dirty his fingers are, but Ethel is so much interested in Mr. Jack that she does not notice how untidy that little Goop is, as he always behaves so nicely. When Dowanto came in, Ethel asked him to put his kite away in the closet, and he scowled and said, “I don’t want to!” When she told him to sit on a chair and watch Mr. Jack quietly, he said, “I don’t want to!” When she said he must go up into the nursery, he cried and screamed, “I don’t want to!” Dowanto has just found a card on the floor; Ethel is asking him to give it to Mr. Jack, and Dowanto is saying, “I don’t want to!” Mr. Jack is very tired of hearing this ill-bred speech, but as he is very fond of Ethel, he does not say a word. It ended by Ethel’s having to stop and send I all the Goops upstairs. Askalotte and Inkfinga went laughing, but Dowanto stamped his foot on the floor and cried, “I don’t want to go!” “O, Dowanto!” Ethel said, "Are you a Goop?""</p>

            <p>First, you must know the names of the people in this picture. The lady on the sofa is Miss Curleykew. Fibius is standing beside her. You need not be afraid that the spiders on the sofa will crawl over him, for they are really only buttons. The old gentleman in the cane-chair is Grandfather, who has fallen asleep while reading “David Grieve.” You can see the book on his lap. In the very front is Elostum. He looks very much troubled because he has lost his cap and can’t find it anywhere. When he came into the house he threw it on the floor. Teeza is behind him helping him look for it. You see, Miss Curleykew has been telling them a story, and when she finished, she told them that they might go out into the woodshed and see the little kittens that came that morning. Elostum is very fond of animals and is in a great hurry, but he can’t find his cap. Fibius is laughing at him, for he knows where it is. It is on the floor, under Grandfather’s chair. You can just see one end of it. Miss Curleykew said, “if you had hung it up properly, you’d know where it is! Goops never put their things away! Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>Fibius and Lemeetri were out in the barnyard playing horse. Of course Lemeetri had to be the driver first, or he wouldn’t play. So he took Fibius’s whip, while Fibius ran with Lemeetri’s windmill. Then Fibius said, “let’s throw stones and see who can come nearest to that window in the barn without hitting it. Erlydyn came along just then, and she said, “you’d better not do it, for you may break the window-pane!” But the two Goops did try it, and after they had thrown a few stones, one that Fibius threw went right through the glass. Miss Curleykew, who had been pruning a rose bush, came running up, when she heard the smash, and so did Cousin Billy, who had been raking the lawn. “Who broke that window?” said Cousin Billy. Nobody answered. “Did you, Lemeetri?” Lemeetri answered, “no!” “Did you do it, Erlydyn?” Erlydyn said, “no!” Cousin Billy turned to Fibius and said, “did you do it, Fibius?” Fibius said, “no, I didn’t do it, Lemeetri did it with a stone!” Then Miss Curleykew, who had seen it all, said, “O, Fibius, how can you tell such a fib?

            <p>When the Goops' mother told them that Mr. Jimmy Payson was coming to dinner, they all wanted to be at the table, because he always made them laugh. But Korlaway annoyed her mother so much, and Obaynotte was so naughty that they were not allowed to eat dinner with the company. Only Goblick was permitted to sit at the table, and when they began dinner, what do you think he did? He licked his lingers, he licked his knife, you never saw such a sight in your life! He growled at the food, and he kicked at his chair, he wiped off his spoon and his fork on his hair! He talked while he chewed, and he teased for more sauce, he took the best orange, and drank like a horse! He played with the salt, and he played with his food, his eating was horribly, horribly rude! He scraped at his plate, and he spilled all his soup, he sneezed and he coughed like the worst kind of Goop. He made such a mess with his butter and bread that his mother could stand it no longer, and said, “Goblick, leave the table instantly. I never saw you behave so badly!” You see Obaynotte and Erlydyn watching him on the stairs? Erlydyn is calling out, “Goblick, Goblick, you make me sick! Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>Hatesope disliked to take his bath so much that once he told Ethel he would strike her with his bat, if she got any soap in his eyes. I think he didn’t really mean it, but he thought it was funny to say it. But he put off his bath as long as he could, and always made a shocking fuss over it. It always took him a long time to undress and place his clothes on a chair, hoping that Ethel would let him off from his washing. He is in the tub now, and is screaming that he is cold and that there is soap in his eyes, and anything else he can think of. It is Elostum’s turn next, and he loves to take a bath, so he is all ready. He has taken his coat off, and come into the bathroom in his trousers, and is laughing at Hatesope. Gablia is talking as usual, waiting for her turn to come. Ethel is hurrying as fast as she can, because she is going to the theatre with Mr. Jack, and she is saying, “if you’d only not squirm, Hatesope, it would be over more quickly!” Gablia is saying, “I’m going to bring in my little ducks and fishes and put them in the water with me, and I hope it will take Ethel four hours to wash me!” Elostum is saying, “Hatesope ought to have to eat a whole cake of soap to keep him from crying! Hatesope, why do you yell so? Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>Here you see Sister Ethel, and Mr. Jack is with her, of course, for he comes to the house quite often. This time he brought a lovely book called “The Confessions of a Minor Poet,” and Ethel laughed a great deal when she read it and looked at the pictures. Then Mr. Jack began to read his diary to her, and she forgot that there were any Goops in the room. But Abednego and Ugpert were there playing their “doctor” game. Abednego is the doctor, and when Ugpert comes in, he looks at her tongue and feels her pulse. But they wouldn’t let Inkfinga play, because when he holds Ugpert’s hand, he always leaves a dirty mark behind. So Inkfinga put his bottle on the floor, and went up to the table and took the book that Mr. Jack had brought. He turned over all the pages and looked at all the pictures. Of course he left a smooch on each. He wiped his fingers on the lace curtains, and then tried to clean the marks off the book with his handkerchief, but he only made them worse. Ethel was so angry that she didn’t know what to say. Mr. Jack knew what to say, but he didn’t dare to say it. “O, Inkfinga!” Ethel said, at last, “how could you touch that book without permission and ruin it? Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>Jardad was never happy unless he was making a loud noise. He loved to rattle a stick along the balusters, the way Erlydyn did, in the mornings, and everywhere he went he stamped his feet and slammed the doors and yelled and pounded and banged things about. He has just found an old tin cracker box, and he is making believe it is a drum, pounding away at it with his hammer till Poutine is frightened and has dropped her basket. Quarling has lain down under the sofa, with his sword, behaving unusually well, for him. Of course, Jardad didn’t know that his mother had a sick headache, or he wouldn’t have made so much noise. He ought to have known, for he could see his mother’s smelling salts and medicine on the little table. After he had pounded a hole through the cracker tin, he kicked it downstairs, then he came back and slammed the door, and played with the curtain shade till it flew up with a bang. He made so much noise that he didn’t hear his mother when she said, “Oh, please be a little quieter! Why must you make such a racket? Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>This lady is Miss Stilcum of Washington; she has a cold, and is eating a cough drop. The Goop with her is Krysoe, who is crying because she will not read to him from his little book. But Miss Stilcum is too busy telling Uncle Harry all about her trip to Europe to listen to this little Goop. It would n’t make much difference if she did, though, for if he isn’t crying about one thing, he is crying about another. At school he cried because he couldn’t feed the goldfish, and he cried at recess because Nevershair wouldn’t give him any of his candy. Then he cried because Miss Stilcum wouldn’t let him take the blacking bottle and paint the beautiful bust that you see on the table. You see. Uncle Harry had just got Destroya and Rodirtygus to playing cat’s cradle, and he thought he could listen in comfort to Miss Stilcum, but Krysoe wanted to play cat’s cradle himself, and cried because the other two wouldn’t let him. He doubled up his fists and hopped up and down, like Bawlfred. Then Uncle Harry got up and said, “what would you think if I made up a face like yours, and cried like a baby? Watch me!” Uncle Harry looked so funny doing what Krysoe did that they all began to laugh. Miss Stilcum said, “now surely you know what you look like when you cry so. Are you a Goop?”</p>

Miss Curleykew took Lemeetri away from the table and made him sit down on the other side of the room, and wait till his turn came.Cousin Billy said, “ Lemeetri, you are too palestric!” and the minister (who had come in for ice-cream) murmured, “quite so, quite so!” It was too bad of Lemeetri to act so, for Mr. Jack had only just given him his windmill. Wonty was blowing it to make it go round and round, when Lemeetri ran up and cried, “let me try!” Miss Curleykew went up to Lemeetri after a while and said, “now, are you going to act nicely, or Are you a Goop?”</p>

He has just found a page where, yesterday, a little Goop drew a large man on the clean, white paper. Who do you think did it? Mudfort, of course. Then he forgot all about it until to-day. Mark Mudfort’s mother didn’t know what to do, for she had just punished him for marking on the walls, which must be painted over because of his scrawling pictures and letters. After he was sent out, Mark Mudfort found Yuwanda, who had wandered away from her home as usual. They played out in the yard for a while, and then Mark said, “let’s play soldiers in the hall.” Yuwanda carefully wiped her feet on the mat, but Mark Mudfort tramped up and down in his muddy boots until the hall was tracked with foot-prints. Then the professor came out and said, “I have known many queer animals, but you are the queerest I ever saw! Are you a Goop?”</p>

While these four were playing in the front yard, Nevershair’s mother called him in and gave him a large yellow banana. “What have you?” asked Verivaine, when he came out. Nevershair laughed and said, “I’ve got something I won’t tell; nine little niggers in a peanut shell.” “It’s a banana,” said Tuchim and Takim. Then Nevershair ran off and hid the banana behind his back. “Give me a bite?” cried Verivaine. “Give me a bite?” cried Tuchim. “Give me a bite?” cried Takim. “No,” said Nevershair. “I am going to eat this banana all myself, and you shan’t have any. When I have eaten this banana I am going to get another banana and eat that myself, and you shan’t have any!” Nevershair did not see Ethel and Mr. Jack, who came by just then.

            <p>Sulkie never really disobeys his parents, but when he is asked to do anything he doesn’t want to do, he sulks so badly that it is almost as bad as if he refused outright, the way Wonty does. He scowls and frowns and whines and whimpers and scuffs his feet and hangs back. This picture shows the yard of the house where Sulkie lives. The Hotel Goop, that Cousin Billy made, is over behind the trees, near where Nibolene is playing tether-ball. Urapyg is running across the lawn shouting that the hotel is on fire, and he wants to use the express-wagon for a fire-engine. Of course the hotel is not really on fire. He is only playing that it is. Quirita has been pulling Sulkie up and down the board walk in the wagon, for she would rather be the horse than the driver. Sulkie has been having so much fun that when Cousin Billy came out on the steps and told him it was time for him to come in and go to bed, he began to sulk, as usual (just like Whymusty and Dowanto) “I don’t see why I have to come in now,” he whined, but he got down very slowly with a very unpleasant expression on his face, hanging back as long as he dared. “You know you have had a sore throat,” Cousin Billy Said, “and it is getting cold and damp, so you ought to be in the house. Why can’t you obey willingly and cheerfully, instead of sulking so? Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>Tuchim has just been up in his father’s room, and has carried away his watch and his best razor to play with, and Takim has just been up in his mother’s room, and has taken away her opera-glasses; and when they have finished playing with them, they will probably leave them in the bath-tub. Yellkum and Stinjessie are looking on, knowing that the twins are going to get into trouble. The picture below shows another of their scrapes. Father was reading quietly in the library. Tuchim got up on a rocking-chair and reached for the candy, while Takim stepped up on the foot of the table and got it first. Then Tuchim’s chair rocked and threw him over, and as he fell he knocked over the lamp, and spilled a glass of water, a can of liquid glue, and a bottle of ink. They all came down together on the floor. Father was just too late to catch them, and was so provoked at the mischief the twins had made that he said, “I never saw so ill-bred a child as you, Tuchim, unless it is you, Takim: Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>This shows the Hotel Goop that Cousin Billy built out of a packing-case. It is fitted up like a little house inside, with a carpet on the floor, and pictures on the walls, and a table and shelves and two chairs. Zelphina is sweeping and dusting it out, as she expects Xcitabelle to call on her this morning. Urapyg and Nevershair wanted to play “fire,” so they got Cousin Billy to set up the ladder against a clothes-pole. Then Cousin Billy sat down on the grass and waited for Miss Curleykew. Just as she came out with Xcitabelle, Nevershair ran up to the top of the ladder, and Urapyg was angry, because he had wanted to go up first. He said, “I am the chief, for I have a fireman’s helmet, and I ought to go first. You ’re a pig to go first, and I won’t play any more!” Miss Curleykew was surprised to hear him use such horrid words, and she said, “Urapyg, you’ll have to wash your mouth out with soap, if you use such bad words.

            <p>Mother was expecting the minister to dinner, and she wanted to cook something very good to eat, as the minister was very fond of food. So she made some sweet soup, and mealy meat-balls, and various vegetables, and prime pudding, and pleasant pie for dinner. But what the minister liked best was home-made bread, for where he lived they got all their bread at a bakery. So she sent Verislow out for a yeast cake early in the afternoon, and told him to come back quickly. But Verislow was so much interested in looking at the pictures on the circus posters that he was a long time getting to the grocery-store, and on his way back he found Piejam and Fijetta playing with a new purple toy balloon. He stayed with them for a whole hour, until Fijetta lost her balloon, and it sailed away in the air. Verislow forgot all about the yeast cake, until his mother came out to the kitchen door, in great anxiety. “O Verislow,” she cried, “you are so late I won’t have time to make any home-made bread for the minister!

            <p>This fat man is Mr. Jack’s father, and Ethel loves to have him call, because he is always so good-natured and jolly. Nothing ever disturbs him. When Teeza teased to be allowed to sit up to the table and write a letter, old Mr. Jack gave her a pencil out of his own pocket to use. When Elostum lost his kite, old Mr. Jack laid down his book and looked all over the house till he found the kite for him. But there is one thing that old Mr. Jack doesn’t like, and that is disobedience. He hates to hear children whine, and he hates to see them sulk, and Whymusty does both. First, Ethel told Whymusty that he must go upstairs and have his face washed, and Whymusty began to scowl, and said, “why must I?” Then old Mr. Jack looked up over his glasses and shook his head. Next, Ethel told Whymusty that he was making so much noise playing soldier and yelling “bang!!!” when he shot off his gun that he must go out in the hall and play, for he was disturbing them. Whymusty said, “why must I?” Old Mr. Jack shook his head again. Then at last Ethel asked Whymusty to go out and bring in the hammock, because it looked like rain, and Whymusty said, “why must I?” So old Mr. Jack said, “Whymusty, if you dress like a soldier you must act like a soldier, and soldiers always obey orders without a question. But if you’re not really a soldier, what are you? Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>This is a kindergarten class out doors in the country, studying nature. The teacher is in front, pointing out a flock of birds to the children, and Miss Curleykew is at the end helping her. They have all come out from the city in a trolley-car, and are having a fine time in the wind and sunshine, looking at all sorts of queer things. They have all behaved nicely except Xaspery, who has done everything he can to annoy his teacher. He ran away down the road after a butterfly, instead of walking quietly in order beside Sulkie, and he snatched at Messalina’s spoon and threw it over the stone wall, and he never listened to what the teacher said, but asked, “what was it?” when she had finished explaining something. He was so exasperating in school to-day that his teacher would not let him take his alpenstock out with him, although you see Mudfort has his spear and Zeemsneaze his drum. Xaspery has just found a worm, and he is so busy looking at it that he doesn’t see the flying birds. Then he looked up too late to see the birds and said, “where are they?” His teacher said to him, “why are you always so heedless and inattentive? Are you a Goop?”</p>

He read, “Do we go up? We do go up. The hen is on the bed.” Then Jotantrum recited “How to Eat Soup,” and forgot only half of it. The two Misses Wigglesworth said that both were charming, and Dr. Golosher that his memory was just like Jotantrum’s. Young Mr. Snale said they both were “very unique.” Then they had tea and began to talk gubble all together. Gubble is the language of tea-parties. Mother was telling what a time she was having with the house-maid when they heard a great noise out in the hall, and Yellkum burst into the room yelling, “Back Bay Station! This train for Baltimore, Toledo, and Northwest Territory! Passengers for Honolulu, Paris, and Asia Minor please change cars! Twenty minutes for refreshments. Beware of pickpockets! Next stop Thirty-Second Street!” Then he began to pound on the piano with his shovel. Young Mr. Snale was so frightened that he nearly dropped his cup and saucer. Ethel came into the room just then, and she said: “Why I haven’t heard such a noise since I was in the Midway Plaisance, Yellkum, Are you a huckster, or Are you a Goop?”</p>

She was too tired, herself. Abednego and Badinskool behaved beautifully, even when the minister pointed his glasses at them and smiled, though they would much rather be out playing than telling how old they were, what they learned in school, and how they liked their teacher. But while the minister was talking to him, Zeemsneaze disgraced himself by wiping his nose on his sleeve. Ethel was shocked. The minister said, “where is your handkerchief, my little man?” Zeemsneaze had left it in the stable, and hadn’t used it all day!

This is what she said: “Eth-el, why aren’t you talking to Mr. Jack any more? Are you mad with Mr. Jack? Mr. Jack, why do you look so cross? Are you mad with Ethel? Ethel, where is your ring?

When they all pulled up their chairs into a circle and began to sing “Thumbkin says, ‘I’ll dance,’” Badinskool saw a bird on a tree. “I want to be a bird!” she said, and began to fly round the room like a bird, waving her arms like wings. Then the teacher took her from the circle and made her sit in her chair by herself, till Badinskool said she would behave better. Afterward, when all the children were making mice out of clay, Badinskool rolled up little balls of clay and threw them at Hatesope and Fibius, then she pinched Jotantrum’s little clay mouse till it was all out of shape. So, because she had been so naughty, the teacher would not give Badinskool any little clay mouse to take home. Are you a Goop? </p>

She threw up the window and called to him, but forgot to put the window down again. It was raining and blowing, so the pretty crisp lace curtains flew out and got wet, and the rain came in and soaked the rug. Then she dropped her doll, and left it where it lay, because she heard Abednego coming in. He had been to see the circus. She ran downstairs and didn’t notice the flower-pot on the table, and knocked it over upon the floor. She tripped on the mat and fell against a little table and upset that, too. A vase that belonged to Askalotte was broken, and Askalotte, who has heard the noise, is coming downstairs to see what is the matter. Her mother has been counting the careless things Carolesse has done. “One, two, three, four, five! Mercy’s sakes alive!” she said. “And you have broken Jotantrum’s fan, too, that makes six; just because you can never be careful and take heed what you do! Think what you’re doing and look where you go, then you ’ll be spared all your worry and woe! If you are not a Goop you’ll learn that, and practise it. Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>This is Destroya cutting out pictures of animals to paste into her circus scrap-book. Her father has given her some newspapers and an old magazine to cut up. She is trying to have a picture of every kind of animal in her book. Badinskool is coming to draw the picture of a lion on her slate. If Destroya cut out pictures only from the books and papers that were given to her, she would never get into trouble, but ever since she was a baby she has liked to tear pages out of books, and cut up papers with her scissors. Just now she is hunting for a picture of a bear, because she needs one for her circus book. As Destroya couldn’t find one, she looked through all the books in her father’s library. Then Jardad told her that there was one in a book called “Farthest North” on the table. Destroya took it down and found a be—autiful bear, and cut it out and pasted it into her own book. Then she cut out a fox and a seal and an albatross and some other strange animals. In the lower picture, you see Father has just found his book. Mother gave it to him for Christmas, and now it is ruined. He is saying, “Destroya, I shall have to take away your scissors and your circus book for a week! I thought you were a little lady. Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>Erlydyn always wakes up early in the morning and comes into her Mother’s room and wakes her up. No matter how tired or sleepy poor Mother is, there is no more sleep for her after that. This morning Erlydyn was worse than usual. She got up at five o’clock and came in and jumped on Mother’s bed. Then she crawled into the bed and teased her Mother for a story. Then she wanted to play that she was a kitten, and that her Mother was the mother cat. Then she wanted to be a little dog, and she crawled way down inside the bed-clothes and barked. Then she got out of bed and brought her woolly sheep and made it squeak “baa—baaa!” Then she wanted to play horse with Mother, and use Mother’s braided hair for the reins. Finally, Erlydyn got up and dressed herself; then, when she found her croquet mallet, she thought she would make believe that the balusters were a piano and play on them with the mallet. She is making a terrific noise, while Messalina and Nevershair, who have been up for some time, are playing quietly; for they know that Ethel was out late at a dance last night, and wants to sleep as long as she can. Mary is taking some breakfast to Uncle Harry’s room, for he has to catch the 6.15 train. Father has just come to the door in his pajamas, and he is saying, “Erlydyn, please let me sleep a little longer. I dreamed that there was an awful thunder storm; but it was only you! Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>Fijetta and Olwaynoy and Quarling are going to have their photographs taken by Cousin Billy. Mother has had a hard time with Quarling who has been quarrelling with Olwaynoy, and so now to punish him Mother has made him sit quietly in a chair until all three are ready. If he gets out of the chair or speaks once he will not have his photograph taken. Olwaynoy has behaved as badly, and now she is hiding Fijetta’s stockings. But Mother is having almost as bad a time with Fijetta, who simply will not keep still while she is being dressed. First, she kept reaching for her beads which were on the bureau, and then she threw them on the floor, and began trying to get her hat. While Mother was putting her shirt on she kept clapping her hands, and while Mother was trying to button it up, she jumped up and down. Nellie the nursemaid has just washed and ironed Fijetta’s frock and is ready to put it on for her. Mother is almost out of patience with this little Goop, because she fidgets when she is being washed and combed and dressed every morning so that it always takes a long time to dress her. When Cousin Billy came in to find out what was delaying them, he said, “Oh, I didn’t know I was going to make a Goop photograph! What’s the matter, Fijetta, Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>Cousin Billy is reading “The Life of the Bee“ to Miss Curleykew, in a shady corner of the orchard. He is sitting in a queer chair that he made himself. Miss Curleykew is almost asleep. Askalotte, Poutine and Inkfinga have been out picking berries, and have just come home. Poutine has a quart of blueberries in her pail. Inkfinga is pouring out the milk that was left in his bottle into the dirt, and he will soon go into the house with muddy hands. Gablia is telling Cousin Billy all about her walk, talking as fast as she can, although he doesn’t want to listen to it now, as he is interested in his book. Gablia is a Goop, however, and keeps right on talking so that he can’t read. She is saying: “We had an awful good time and we picked a quart of blueberries and we ate them half up and we drank the milk and I saw two cows and I was n’t afraid at all, but Poutine was and Inkfinga threw a stick at them and they ran away and then we went in wading in the brook and Carolesse came along and dropped her doll — ” “Never mind, now,” Cousin Billy is saying, “I want to read!” “But we had to fish the doll out of the brook,” Gablia went on. “It’s very interesting,” Cousin Billy said, “but if you’ll talk it into my phonograph I’ll listen to it later. I’m busy, now. Are you going to run away and leave us alone, or Are you a Goop?"</p>

            <p>This is a golf tournament, and Ethel is driving from the third hole. Miss Stilcum of Washington has just driven off, and Uncle Harry is over the other side of the hill, telling Ethel which way to drive. Mr. Jack is just coming up, but you can’t see him yet. They all went out to the links in an electric car together, taking Haychu and Obaynotte with them. These two little Goops quarrelled all the way out. Haychu wanted the end seat, and when Ethel told her she must sit inside, she said to Obaynotte, “you are mean not to give me the end seat when we got in! You are a nelephant, and I hate you!” They found Hatesope out at the links, and as he wanted to be Ethel’s caddy, she is letting him carry her clubs. Obaynotte is teaching Haychu to play golf, but she won’t listen; she wants to try herself, before she knows how. She is calling Obaynotte all sorts of horrid names because he won’t let her take his clubs. Then, at last, when she tried to use the clubs Obaynotte laughed at her, and she lost her temper. “You are an old niblick, that’s what you are, and I hate you! ” she said. When Obaynotte told her he would show her how, she said, “go away! I hate you!” When Cousin Billy came round to where they were, he heard Haychu saying to Obaynotte, “I ’ll slap your face for you, you horrid thing, I hate you!” He felt very badly to think that she would talk so, and he said, “if you knew how ugly you looked when you spoke so angrily, you would never do it again. You look as ugly as a Goop. Are you a Goop?"</p>

This is the way she annoys them: Ethel: Now there’s Professor Inchworm; I wonder if we ought — Intrupta: Eth-el, where is my jump-rope? Ethel: There it is on the floor right in front of you. I suppose we really ought to invite him. Mr. Jack: I don’t know, if we only didn’t have so many relatives — Intrupta: Can I go to school to-morrow without my jacket on ? Ethel: Do run away and play, please. Of course, if we have Cousin Billy at the ceremony, we must have Miss Curleykew. Do you know — Intrupta: Gablia’s going to school without a jacket. Can’t I? Mr. Jack: Yes, I have been wondering if it weren’t time for it to be announced. If Harry would only come to the point — Intrupta: Eth-el! do you know where Fibius is? Ethel: It would be a good chance for a double wedding, wouldn’t it ? Now what are we going to do with Grandfather? Somebody will have — Intrupta: Eth-el! can I have a party to-morrow?

Jotantrum wanted to go with her. “No,” said Mother, “not to-day.” Then Jotantrum stamped her foot on the ground so hard that she fell over and lay on her back kicking and screaming with all her might. “I want to go! I want to go!” she cried. Just then Verislow and Haychu came by and said, “come along with us! We are going to sail boats in the pond.” “I won’t go! I want to go to ride with my mother,” the little Goop screamed. Verislow and Haychu were so horrified to see her act this way that they walked off and left her. This made Jotantrum angrier still. Then a little dog came up and began to bark at her. Jotantrum got up then and hit the dog with her fan, and the little dog snapped at her so that she was frightened and ran in the house. When Nelly the nurse saw Jotantrum’s dress all covered with dust she said, “now you must be washed, and put on a clean frock.” Then the little Goop had another tantrum. She screamed and kicked so hard that you could hear her for nearly a block away. Charles the coachman is saying to Frank the footman, “Frank, this off horse has only three legs!

This picture shows how Lazileva had all the furniture of her doll’s house broken. After luncheon she decided to clean house. So she took all the chairs and tables out of the bed-room and the dining-room and the parlor of her house, and put them on the floor. Then she got a little whisk-broom from behind the bath-room door, and began to sweep the carpets of her little house. While she was washing the windows, Elostum came in and asked her to go out and play squat-tag with him and Gablia. So she went out and left her things all lying about on the floor.

            <p>These Goops were invited to a party at Xcitabelle’s house one afternoon, and Messalina was so much in a hurry to go that she asked to be dressed first. So she was dressed first, and her mother put some fresh flowers in her hat. The day before, Messalina had been out in the rain and the color had washed out of the flowers and stained her face so red and green that everybody called her a Goop. When Messalina was dressed, she took the old flowers and went out in the garden to plant them. She dug a hole in the dirt with her wooden spoon and stuck the flowers into it, and made such a mess that soon her face and her hands and her frock were very dirty. So, when Ethel and Mr. Jack came out with Korlaway and Yellkum to go to the party, they found Messalina had to be washed and dressed all over again! Mr. Jack went on with Korlaway and Yellkum, while Ethel took Messalina back into the house. Messalina had soiled her white slippers so badly that she had to wear her old black ones to the party; and she got there too late to get any ice-cream. And she cried. “It’s your own fault,” Ethel said to her, “for if you hadn’t made such a mess after you were dressed, you would have been on time. Are you a Goop?”</p>

She ate so much between meals that she seldom had any appetite at the table. In the picture below the dressmaker is making Ethel’s clothes for the wedding. She has been telling fairy stories to Zeemsneaze and Xcitabelle. Minnie the maid is bringing her a pot of tea. Nibolene has just come in and has told about a lovely cake with white frosting that she found in the pantry. “Did you nibble any of it?” the dressmaker asked. Nibolene had to confess that she did. “I thought so,” said the dressmaker, “and you have bitten your own nose off, that’s what you have done! To-morrow is your birthday and your mother was going to give you a surprise party. The cake was for a birthday cake, and it was going to have five candles on it, for you will be five years old to-morrow. But now, of course, you will have no party because you have no cake. It seems to me you are fond of Goop food. “You should never eat anything between meals without asking your mother’s consent. I knew a little girl once who was so greedy that she ate a whole cake.

            <p>This is May-day, and these children are twining a May-pole, dancing round and round and in and out, till all the ribbons are twisted on the pole. Cousin Billy got up the party; he chose the children and taught them how to do it. Now, Olwaynoy wanted to be one of them very much, but Cousin Billy wouldn’t have her because she teased and annoyed the others so much. She got very angry because she couldn’t dance, and while they were twining the pole with the ribbons, she ran away from her mother, and did her best to spoil the dance. She pinched them as they went by, and she tripped them up; she pushed them and she snatched at what they were carrying. She took their hats and threw them over the fence. Finally, she threw a piece of dirt at Yuwanda. Then Cousin Billy stopped the dance and had Olwaynoy taken home and sent to bed, and so she missed the Punch-and-Judy show, and the lemonade and ice-cream and cake. Olwaynoy is about the worst of all the Goops. She always does a thing once more, after you tell her to stop! She certainly is a Goop! Are you a Goop?</p>

            <p>Ethel and Mr. Jack, in the row boat, and Cousin Billy and Miss Curleycue in the canoe, are going up river to get Uncle Henry and Miss Stilcum, who are at the club house. When they come back, they are all going to have a picnic under the trees beside the river. Verislow is sailing his boat with Fijetta. They have both taken off their shoes and stockings and put them on a rock. Verislow is so afraid that his boat will be run down that he is shouting to Mr. Jack to look out for it. Fijetta is shouting, too. Poutine came up the river with Ethel and Mr. Jack in the row boat, and when they got here, Ethel made Poutine get out and wait on the bank for them, for there would not be room for her in the boat, when Uncle Harry and Miss Stilcum got in. Poutine is very cross at being left behind. She got out slowly and sulkily, and made an awful face. She said, “I should think you might take me up the river. It’s mean!” Ethel and Mr. Jack are laughing at Poutine, for she is pouting and scowling, as she always does when she can’t have her own way.“I want to go!” Poutine said. “I don’t want to stay here at all!” Ethel only smiled at her and said, “remember the picnic we are going to have when we come back! Goops will not be allowed at our picnic; Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>The Goop Family are having supper, and Matthew, the Minister’s son, has come in with Ethel to see them. Lazileva is late, of course. She put off washing her face and hands till the supper-bell rang. Inkfinga came in a hurry, but he didn’t remember to wash at all! Mary the maid is bringing in a potato pie. Matthew the Minister’s son is staring at Quirita, because he never saw anybody eat so queerly in his life. She is eating a whole cream-cake at one bite, and you will soon see the cream all over her face where it has squirted out. I hate to think of it. Nelly the nurse has already had to take away Quirita’s mug, for she put her fingers in it, and when it was emptied, she threw her head back and tried to balance the mug on her face. Quirita gobbled and gugged. She made shocking noises, and all the time she was not eating she played with her knife or fork or spoon or the salt or her napkin ring, instead of keeping her hands in her lap the way Ethel does. She blew and bubbled into the water when she drank out of her glass, she squeaked her knife on her plate, and she reached out and took the strawberries from the dish with her fingers! Matthew is saying, “I suppose. Miss Ethel, Quirita should be considered as essentially medieval in her manners.” What he means is, that Quirita is a Goop. Are you a Goop?</p>

            <p>This very good-looking young man is Mr. Jimmie Bimm, who is to be the best man when Mr. Jack is married to Ethel. Mr. Jack is introducing him to Ethel’s mother. Jimmie Bimm would enjoy his call better if it wasn’t for Rudella. She has been acting so rudely that he scarcely knows what to say. Rudella pranced across right in front of him while he was saying to Ethel’s mother, “I thought you were Miss Ethel’s sister!” Then Rudella crowded in between him and Mr. Jack, and said, “here! get out of my way!” After that she shot arrows at Jimmie Bimm’s back till he grew quite nervous. Piejam is under the desk, eating a banana; he is hiding so he won't have to stop and be introduced to Jimmie Bimm. Zelphina is wondering whether Mr. Jack has brought any candy for her, and if not, she hopes they will go away, so she can play in the room. When Rudella asked Jimmie Bimm if he were going to stay to dinner, and told him not to sit in her chair, and scolded him for stepping on her arrows, Ethel could stand it no longer and said: “Rudella, I don’t know what Mr. Bimm will think of you! You are as rude as a rhinoceros! Are you a Goop?”</p>

It is a fine, Spring morning, and Stinjessie has just come out with her things to play on the doorstep. She brought out her doll and her horse and the little table, in her doll’s trunk, then went back for her hoop. Her doll’s name is Delia. Nibolene and Obaynotte are asking Stinjessie if they can play on her doorstep with her toys, and Stinjessie is saying, “no, you can’t; I want to play here myself!” So, when Uncle Harry and Miss Stilcum, of Washington, came down the street, Nibolene and Obaynotte went along with them. After they had left, Stinjessie was sorry she had not let them stay, for now she had to play all the forenoon alone. So, after she had taken her doll’s clothes out of the trunk and dressed her, she said, “Delia, I hope you won’t grow up to be as selfish and stingy as your mother, but I am afraid you are getting more like me every day! Are you a Goop?”</p>

It isn’t strong enough without them!” Teeza teased. Miss Curleykew only said, “Love, Thirty!” for she wanted to go on with her game. “Please can’t we?” Teeza said again. “No, dear,” said Miss Curleykew, and then she ran for the ball. Verivaine was so intent upon looking at herself in her mirror that she walked right into the tennis court, and Miss Curleykew ran into her and knocked her over. But Verivaine was not hurt much. “Then won’t you come and show us how to make a church out of sand?” Teeza said. “Not now, dear,” said Miss Curleykew. “Why not?” Teeza insisted. “I think it’s mean you won’t come!” Then Cousin Billy shouted, “Teeza, will you tell me something?” “What is it?” Teeza asked. “What I want to know is,” he said, “Are you a Goop?”</p>

Quirita likes the Minister, because he always gives her a cough-drop when he sees her. She is eating one now. Goblick has been showing the Minister and Cousin Billy how well he can snap marbles. When Ugpert came into the parlor, the Minister said, “ how do you do, little girl, what is your name?” “Puddin’ tame!” said Ugpert, trying to be smart. “You look as if you had been having a good time,” the Minister said. “You look like a goat!” said Ugpert. “Oh, Ugpert, how can you say such a thing,” Miss Curleykew cried. “I can say it with my mouth!” said Ugpert, trying to be funny. “Speak politely,” said Cousin Billy, “or Dr. White will think you’re a Goop.” “His boots are dirty!” said Ugpert, and she stuck out her tongue at the Minister and walked off!

Verivaine has been watching the dressmaker, wishing that she could have some new frocks made, for she loves to dress up and show herself off. Verivaine thinks she is so pretty that she spends half her time in front of the mirror, nodding her head this way and that, and prinking like a cockatoo. She has been looking in Ethel’s bureau drawers and has taken out and tried on all Ethel’s jewelry. She put on three rings and two necklaces and four diamond pins and then went and sat by the window, so that people could see her. She has arranged her veil a different way over her head and she thinks she is very beautiful. A favorite trick of hers is to walk slowly up and down the steps of the finest house in the neighborhood, so that people will think she lives there. Did you ever hear of anyone as vain as that? Destroya is letting the dressmaker use her scissors, but wants to use them herself in a minute, to cut the picture of a horse out of the newspaper. Surleigh is saying, “Oh, I see a mouse!” hoping Ethel will jump up on a chair. But Ethel doesn’t believe him.

When the front door bell rings, both the twins rush downstairs and take the parcels and bring them up to Ethel. Whynotte is wearing one of Wonty’s dresses. After they had done this a while, the twins wanted to open the packages themselves. Wonty opened one, and found a bust of Shakespeare from Mr. Snale, and Whynotte opened another and found a picture of the Minister which he had sent himself. But after they had opened a few more, they got the cards all mixed up, so that Ethel could not tell who had sent the presents. Wonty put Cousin Billy’s card on a satin-lined brush and comb case, that looked like a book when it was shut. Mr. Jack thought it must be one of Billy’s jokes. But it was really Mary the maid who had sent it. Whynotte put Miss Stilcum’s card on a clock that Prof. Inchworm had sent. Then Ethel said, “ you must not open any more parcels!” and Whynotte said, “Why not?” She began to open another. Then Mr. Jack said, “you must leave all the presents alone! ” and Wonty said, “I won’t!” And she kept on touching them. That is the way they always behaved. They usually kept right on as they were doing before. They were Goops, and couldn’t help it. Are you a Goop?</p>

To-day she is giving a party. When she was in Kindergarten she got up and ran up to her teacher many times and shouted out, “I’m going to have a party to-day!” till she had to sit all alone till she could grow quiet. In the afternoon she could hardly wait till she was dressed, but kept jumping up and down and running up and down stairs like a runaway horse. When Cousin Billy came, she ran to meet him with a loud scream, and then ran upstairs shouting at the top of her voice, “COUSIN BILLY’S COME!” She slammed the doors and tipped over chairs until Mother told her she would have to be sent to bed if she didn’t act more quietly. Now they are having the party, and Cousin Billy is playing “Blind Man’s Buff” with them. Xcitabelle is shrieking and laughing at the top of her voice, and hopping up and down and stamping her feet, she is having such a good time. No one can be so noisy as Xcitabelle, when she is playing a game, not even Yellkum. When they had finished the game, Xcitabelle ran all over the house crying, “WE’RE GOING TO HAVE ICE-CREAM!

            <p>Yuwanda was forbidden ever to go outside the front gate, but this morning she waited till no one was looking, and ran down the road. She found Whymusty playing on some lumber in front of Mr. Jack’s new house. He pulled a board off the top, put it across a saw-horse to make a see-saw, and asked Yuwanda to tilt with him. The man sitting on the fence is a carpenter. While Yuwanda was up high in the air, Whymusty saw a policeman coming along. Whymusty was afraid of being scolded for meddling with the boards, so he started to get off and run away. The policeman came up just in time to save Yuwanda from a bad fall, and he scolded Whymusty for being so thoughtless. Mary the maid is running to get Yuwanda, for Father has just come home and wants to take her to Boston with him on the next train. Father and Mother are both calling her.But Yuwanda was so late that she couldn’t be dressed in time. Father was angry and said, “you disobeyed me, so now you will have to stay at home with Mary.Are you a Goop?”</p>

            <p>This is Ethel’s wedding, and she is walking up the aisle with her father. Poutine is the flower-maid and is strewing roses on the floor. Lemeetri is carrying the ring on a cushion. Rudella and Carolesse are holding the bridal veil. All the Goops are there, and they have left their toys in the vestibule. Mr. Jack’s twin brother is on one of the front seats.Zelphina was to have been flower-maid, and this is how it happened that she is not. She kept Mary the maid busy waiting on her, and let all the others dress themselves as best they could. When she was all ready, her mother asked her to help Fijetta get her shoes on. But as Zelphina wanted to see which carriage she was going in, she ran away instead, and hid in the pantry where her mother couldn’t find her. There she stayed, watching out the window.While she was there, it came time for Ethel to go to the church, and as no one could find Zelphina, Poutine was asked to take her place as flower-girl. When Zelphina came out, all the family had driven off without her. So she had to walk to church and sit all alone. That is what came of her being so selfish a Goop.Are you a Goop?</p>
