                    <l>A begins Apple, so juicy and sweet, </l>
                    <l>That, when ripe in Autumn, we all like to eat, </l>
                    <l>A begins Acorn,—the oak's seed, you know: </l>
                    <l>How strange that from it such a great tree should grow </l>
                    <l>Anchor, made strong, the deep sea-bed to grip; </l>
                    <l>That stops in a moment the mightiest ship.</l>

                    <l>That stands in that record for praise or for blame.</l>

                    <l>I should not much like to be mounting so high,</l>
                    <l>Bramble, on which, when the autumn comes round,</l>

                    <l>And Crocus, that in the cold spring loves to bloom.</l>
                    <l>Church, where we all love on Sunday to go.</l>
                    <l>Castle, that towers o'er the country below.</l>

                <l>Or He will reprove thee for breaking this law.</l>
                <l>Remember the Sabbath, of all days the host:</l>
                <l>Work six, keep the seventh for worship and rest.</l>
                <l>Honour thy parents, if thou wouldst live long.</l>
                <l>Thou shalt not kill, with the sword or the tongue.</l>
                <l>Avoid thoughts and actions unclean or impure.</l>
                <l>Beware that thou steal not, although thou be poor.</l>
                <l>Thou no false witness 'gainst any shalt bear,</l>
