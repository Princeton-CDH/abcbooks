               <l>Yes! Willy is the proudest boy</l>
               <l>In juvenile creation;</l>
               <l>For some one said Kriss Kingle was</l>
               <l>A family relation.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But as Kriss Kingle turned to go</l>

               <l>Cried "Much obliged!" and laughed to see</l>

               <l>I'd love to have you, dearly;</l>
               <l>Then I'd have presents all the time</l>

            <lg>

               <l>Tried, with amazing incident,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And so when Ted remarked to Dick</l>
               <l>That "Once I ate a horse;"</l>
               <l>The other laughed because he thought</l>
