               <l>Yes! Willy is the proudest boy</l>
               <l>In juvenile creation;</l>
               <l>For some one said Kriss Kingle was</l>
               <l>A family relation.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But as Kriss Kingle turned to go</l>
               <l>He heard a shout, as Willy</l>
               <l>Cried "Much obliged!" and laughed to see</l>
               <l>Kriss Kingle look so silly.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"Say, why not come and live with us?</l>
               <l>I'd love to have you, dearly;</l>
               <l>Then I'd have presents all the time</l>

            </lg>

               <l>And saw Kriss Kingle in the room</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He filled the stockings to the top</l>
               <l>With sweets and treasure splendid;</l>
               <l>And Willy never made a sound,</l>

               <l>Tried, with amazing incident,</l>
               <l>The other to outdo.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And so when Ted remarked to Dick</l>
               <l>That "Once I ate a horse;"</l>
               <l>The other laughed because he thought</l>
