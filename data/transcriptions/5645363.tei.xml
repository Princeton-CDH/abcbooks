               <l>A for the Arab. He lives in Arabia and in North Africa. He is a tall,
                  noble-looking man, frank and bold, but hot-tempered and revengeful. He dwells in
                  tents, and with his flocks and herds moves from place to place, just as his
                  forefathers did in Bible times. His beautiful white horse is tenderly cared for;
                  but his greatest treasure is his camel, on which he journeys across the burning
                  sandy plains. The camel is rightly called “ the ship of the desert.” He can travel
                  long distances without water, and he will live on coarse salt shrubs that any
                  other creature would turn up its nose at. If a stranger comes to an Arab’s tent
                  and asks for food and shelter, he is always gladly received and well treated. The
                  Arab is a follower of the prophet Mohammed, and at the time of prayer, wherever he
                  may be, he spreads his carpet, and turning his face to the holy city, says his
                  prayers very devoutly. </l>

               <l> B for Briton. Though his home is in little isles set in a northern sea, you will
                  find him in every part of the world, for he is never so much at home as when he is
                  abroad. He is strong and hardy, dogged and brave, just and generous, and a lover
                  of fair play. He belongs to a nation of sailors, and wherever a ship can sail,
                  there you will find the British flag fluttering in the breeze. Every briton is
                  proud of the Royal Navy. To her sailors Britain owes her colonies and foreign
                  possessions, which cover one-fifth of all the land on the globe, and include
                  one-fourth of the world's inhabitants. The British army, though not large, is
                  "ready to go anywhere and do anything." Rule, Britannia! </l>

               <l> C for Cossack. His home-is on the wide, dreary plains or steppes of south-east
                  Russia. His forefathers were fierce warriors who feared nothing, and loved liberty
                  better than life itself. The Cossack is a splendid horseman, and is more at home
                  in the saddle than on foot. He is a soldier of the Czar, and he bears hunger,
                  thirst, cold, and fatigue without complaining. As a scout he has hardly an equal.
                  He knows the steppe as a good boy knows his book, and can track a foe by the most
                  trifling signs. In winter, when the land is white with snow, he sometimes has to
                  face wolves, which are then mad with hunger. Travellers are sometimes overtaken
                  and devoured by them. Let us hope that the men in this picture will escape such a
                  terrible fate. </l>

                  see how smart and neat she is ; and you need not be surprised, for the Dutch are
                  the cleanest people in Europe, and their housewives are always busy washing,
                  scouring, and polishi the girl you can see a canal and windmill. Everywhere the
                  land is crossed and recrossed by canals, and everywhere you see windmills, with
                  their great arms going round and round. In winter the canals are frozen, and then
                  everybody skates. Men skate to their work, women to market, and children to
                  school. The men wear short blue jackets and very baggy trousers ; and all poor
                  people wear wooden shoes, which make a great clatter on the pavements. The Dutch
                  are excellent farmers and good sailors. They make a great deal of cheese. The
                  little round cheeses you see in shops come from Holland. </l>

                  of it green and fertile. Egypt is full of ruins of pyramids, temples, and tombs,
                  which were built in days long before the time when the Israelites were bondmen in
                  the land. The Great Pyramid is not far from Cairo, the capital of the country. It
                  was built five thousand years ago. It is higher than the highest spire in Europe,
                  and there are seven million tons of stone in it. It took one hundred thousand men
                  thirty years to build it. Beside it is a huge man-headed lion called the Sphinx.
                  Formerly the Egyptians were badly treated by their rulers, who robbed them right
                  and left. Now the British rule the country, and their lot is a much happier one.
                  At one time they had to be driven to fight with whips. Now the “Gippies” are
                  capital soldiers, and a few years ago they fought very bravely against the
                  Dervishes side by side with British soldiers. </l>

               <l> F for Frenchman. Fie calls his land “ Beautiful France,” and loves it very
                  dearly. The French people have been called the “liveliest nation in the world.”
                  They are certainly fond of plays, dancing, and music; but they are gallant
                  soldiers as well, and, as a people, they love warlike glory. Quick and clever,
                  they are famous for their tact, good taste, and polite manners. Paris, their
                  capital, is sometimes called “The Gay City.” It has fine buildings, beautiful
                  tree-shaded streets, and fine shops. One of its oldest buildings is the cathedral
                  of Notre Dame. It is six hundred years old, and its front is a mass of fine
                  carving. The country people are very simple and hard-working. On the coast they
                  are fishermen, and inland there are many vine-yards. In the south part of the
                  country there are many mulberry trees, on the leaves of which the silk-worms,
                  which make the silk for ribbons and ladies’ dresses, are fed. </l>

               <l> G for Greek. In ancient clays the Greeks were a strong and gifted race. Among
                  them were some of the greatest poets, historians, speakers, and thinkers that the
                  world has ever known. Their books are read even now in our schools and colleges.
                  The ancient Greeks loved everything that was beautiful, and their sculptors,
                  painters, and builders produced works which have never been excelled. In Athens,
                  their capital, and in other places, we may see the grand old ruins of their
                  wonderful buildings. But evil times came upon them. They lost their freedom, and
                  at last were overcome by the Turks. Since 1822, however, they have been free,
                  though they were badly beaten in 1897 by their old masters. The Greeks of to-day
                  are excellent seamen and clever traders—too clever, sometimes, for they are apt to
                  be cunning and untruthful. They are very fond of music, and of singing songs to
                  the strains of the guitar. Most of their songs are rather sad, because many of
                  them recall the days when the Greeks were the bondmen of the cruel Turks. </l>

               <l> H for Hindu. In the vast country of India, which belongs to Britain, live about
                  one-fifth of all the people in the world, and most of them are Hindus. Though they
                  have dark-brown skins, they belong to the same family of the human race as we do.
                  As their country is a very hot one, they do not wear much clothing; but what they
                  do wear is very gay indeed—white, red, scarlet, orange, and yellow. Some of the
                  native princes wear rich robes, which are studded all over with diamonds, pearls,
                  and other precious stones. The elephants upon which they ride are covered with
                  gold-embroidered cloths and trappings of the most costly kind. The Hindus are
                  divided into almost countless classes, called castes; and men and women of one
                  caste will not marry, or eat with, or visit those of another caste. It is this
                  great disunion amongst the Hindus which enables the British to rule them. Many
                  Hindus serve in the British army, and are fine soldiers. </l>

                  sister Norah, with her bright eyes, her winning ways, and her ready tongue. If you
                  ever visit the Emerald Isle, you will have an “ illigant time, indade ! ” and when

               <l> J for the Jap. He lives in Japan—a group of islands to the east of Northern Asia.
                  He is a little fellow, with a sallow face and lank, black hair. When he wears his
                  native costume, he puts on a long, loose silk robe, with a girdle at the waist,
                  and he never goes abroad without his paper umbrella and his fan. The Japanese
                  ladies, like ladies all the world over, delight in dress. They wear a
                  bright-coloured undergarment of silk, over which are two or three, and sometimes
                  five or six, flowing robes of crape or silk. All these garments, which are open at
                  the neck, are girdled round the waist by a huge satin sash, tied behind in a large
                  square bow. Japanese ladies are dainty little people, and are very proud of their
                  hair, which they decorate with flowers. All the Japs are fond of music,
                  storytelling, kite-flying, juggling, and plays. They like to resort to
                  flower-gardens and tea-houses, where they enjoy themselves very much. They are
                  very skilful workmen, and have trains and trams, telephones and telegraphs,
                  men-of-war, and a parliament, just as we have. Here is a picture of the Japanese

                  with thick lips and woolly hair. He used to be very fond of fighting, and with his
                  assegai, his knobkerry, and ox-hide shield he has fought against British troops.
                  Now he is peaceable, and lives in his kraal with his wives, who plant the mealies
                  and do all the work while he lolls about smoking, palavering, and sometimes
                  hunting. Some of the Kafirs work in the gold and diamond mines for months at a
                  time. When they get their pay and go home again, they swagger about amongst their
                  friends as wealthy men.Other Kafirs help the farmers to till the fields, tend the
                  cattle, or look after the ostriches. Thousands of Kafirs have now become
                  Christians, and have been taught trades. Most of them, however, still believe in
                  ghosts, worship snakes, and are terribly afraid of the “witch doctor.” </l>

                  north of Europe. Their land is barren and dreary, but they love it very dearly for
                  all that. Very little will grow, so the Lapp depends upon his reindeer, just as
                  the Arab depends on his camels. 1 he reindeer not only gives him food, drink,
                  shelter, and clothing, but drags his boat-shaped sledge from place to place. The
                  Lapps live in tents made of skins or coarse cloth. Dogs, men, women, and children
                  huddle together for warmth; and when a fire is lighted you may guess how hot and
                  stuffy the tent becomes. The “fishing Lapps” live near the Frozen Ocean. They are
                  splendid fishermen, and even the boys can manage a canoe very well. </l>

                  were the fiercest and most warlike race in the whole of Asia. Much of their
                  country consists of a vast “sea of sand,” other parts of it are bare and treeless,
                  but in the north-west there are some fertile valleys. Many of the Mongols are rich
                  in flocks and herds, and these they drive from feeding-ground to feeding-ground,
                  like the Arabs. Of course they live in tents, which are their only protection
                  against the sandstorms of summer and the fierce snowstorms of winter. They almost
                  live on horseback or camel-back, so that their lees are short and bent. They have
                  flat, broad faces, dumpy noses, and eyes set at a slant. The women do all the
                  buying and selling and much of the work, while the men enjoy themselves in hunting
                  and hawking. Some of the best falcons in the world are to be seen amongst the

                  winter is very long and very cold. The summer, however, makes amends, and for
                  weeks together the sun never sets at all, but is above the horizon all the time.
                  Many tourists come in yachts to see the “ midnight sun ; ” and this N orse girl is
                  ready to bid the stranger welcome, for she and her people consider friendliness a
                  duty, and from their earliest years the children are taught to be pleasant and
                  kind to everybody. The Norse people are of the same race as the English ; they are
                  brave, hardy, and freedom-loving. Much of their land is bare rock, but wherever
                  there is fertile land it is most carefully tilled. When summer comes the farmers
                  drive their oxen, goats, and sheep to the green meadows high up the mountains.
                  There those who look after the cattle live in rough wooden huts. In winter the

                  Poor people wear cotton gowns and cotton trousers. The rich wear over their cotton

                  fields ; he has no flocks and herds, and so he is always on the move in search of
                  food and water. Sometimes he kills birds with his boomerang, and sometimes he
                  manages to spear a kangaroo or an opossum. The blackfellows are now dying out, and
                  before long there will be none of them left. Many of the white Queenslanders live
                  on cattle-ranches. They are fine horsemen, and with their long stock whips they
                  manage the halfwild cattle wonderfully well. </l>

                  a light-hearted and cheerful fellow, though, unhappily, he is very ignorant.
                  Though he is a poor farmer, his land grows much wheat and maize, which are
                  exported to other countries. He also rears large numbers of sheep, cattle, pigs,
                  and horses. He is now independent, but for many years his land was ruled by the
                  Turks. PI is national dance, called the Hora, is a sort of play representing the
                  way in which he won his freedom. The dancers first move forward in pairs, then the
                  men and women separate, and the men dance round in a great ring, while the women
                  wander round as if seeking for some one they have lost. Presently the men draw
                  close together and make a “tramp, tramp” with their feet like soldiers marching.
                  Next they gather in a crowd and imitate fighting. At last they give a loud shout
                  of joy to show that the battle is won. Then the women run and join their partners,
                  and the dance concludes with merry romps and gay laughter, to show that war is
                  over at last, and Roumania is free and happy once more. </l>

               <l> S for Spaniard. He lives in “ Sunny Spain,” which is one of the most interesting
                  countries of Europe. As a rule, he is ignorant and cruel, but he has very noble
                  manners. This Spaniard is a bull-In every town there is a large circus with seats
                  one above the other, on which thousands of people sit every Sunday afternoon to
                  watch the so-called sport. The bull is driven into the arena; then, on horseback,
                  men armed with lances stab the creature to make it angry. The narrow escapes of
                  these men make the crowd very excited. Then the bull-fighter appears, and the bull
                  dashes towards him, head down. A quick leap, and the bullfighter is out of the way
                  of the sharp horns, while the bull goes crashing by. Again and again the bull is
                  tricked, until at last, as the animal charges him, the bull-fighter steps aside
                  and plunges his sword up to the hilt between the victim’s shoulder-blade and
                  spine. The bull falls dead, and the bull-fighter bows to the audience, who show
                  their delight by waving handkerchiefs and shouting lustily. Bullfighting is a
                  disgusting pursuit, and we may be glad that it is not permitted in our country.

                  for him. He loves to sit cross-legged on a low sofa or “ divan,” smoking a “
                  hookah ” and drinking coffee. Many Turks now dress as we do, except that they wear
                  a red cap or fez, but at home they dress like the man in the picture. Their women
                  seldom go out of doors, and when they do they cover up their faces with veils.
                  Indoors, howvere, they wear gay dresses. All the household work is done by slaves.

                  Europe, and some people think that the Turks ought to be driven out of Europe

                  country for one hundred and twenty-seven years, it has already left most European
                  countries far behind, and bids fair, some day, to lead the world. Nature has given

                  sea-born. It is built in the sea, and has the sea for its streets and highways.
                  Its palaces, temples, and houses are built on seventy-two islands; and there are
                  about one hundred and fifty canals, including the Grand Canal, which is more than
                  two miles long. It is bordered by marble palaces and crossed by several splendid
                  bridges, the most beautiful being that of the Rialto. There are no cabs,
                  omnibuses, drays, wagons, or vans in Venice. Instead of these the Venetians have
                  black boats called gondolas, in which they glide about to do their shopping,
                  visiting, church-going, and sight-seeing. The gondoliers sing as they row their
                  boats along, and the strains mingle pleasantly with the ripple of the water. Above
                  all is the clear blue sky, and the dazzling sunlight is reflected on the red-brown
                  sails, of the quaint vessels. </l>

                  with coal-black faces, woolly hair, and teeth like ivory. Their forefathers were
                  brought as slaves to these islands to work in the sugar plantations. Notice the
                  basket on the woman’s head. It contains bananas, pine apples, oranges, and other
                  tropical fruits, which all grow splendidly in the West Indies. There are great
                  sugar plantations in the islands ; and when the canes are ripe the little nigger
                  boys and girls grow very fat, for they may be seen sucking the juice out of a
                  sugar-cane all day long. Some of the West India Islands belong to Britain, and the
                  negroes and negresses sing “God save the King! ” just as Britons do. Many of the
                  islands are very beautiful indeed. Richly clothed in evergreen forests, they

                  a negro. But look at his hair. Instead of growing smoothly, as ours does, it grows
                  over his head in little tufts, like peppercorns. The man in the picture has just
                  speared an antelope, and very proud he is of the feat. Sometimes he goes fishing
                  and sometimes he hunts the hippopotamus and the elephant. His land is full of
                  india-rubber trees, and when rubber is wanted, he taps the trees by making a cut
                  in the bark from the root to the lowest branch, and various other cuts running
                  from it at right angles. Then down the long cut runs the sap, which drips into a
                  calabash. When this is filled, it is placed over a fire, the heat of which causes
                  the liquid rubber to thicken, and thus become ready for trade. The Yorubas must
                  not be called savages, and are skilful blacksmiths, brass, leather, and glass

                  and woolly, their foreheads are high, their eyes are bright, and they carry
                  themselves with great dignity. Usually they clothe themselves in ox-hides,
                  leopard-skins, and blankets, but their cup of joy is full if they can dress up in
                  the old red coat of a soldier. They are a very warlike people. Under their chief
                  Cetewayo they fought against the British, who were well armed and well trained,
                  yet could not conquer them for quite a long time. Amongst those who were killed in
                  this Zulu War was the Prince Imperial, son of Napoleon the Third. At the time of
                  his death he was serving as an officer in the British army.- Many of the Zulus
                  still live in tribes, and have villages of beehive-shaped houses. They are now
                  quite peaceable, and do most of the heavy work in the mines and on the farms.</l>
